Python Loops
-----------------------

loop executes a piece of code until the condition satisfies
iterate a seq
traverse


It enables instead of writing the same code again and again, we can repeat the same code
for a finite number of times. 

For example, if we need to print the first 10 natural numbers then, 
instead of using the print statement 10 times, 
we can print inside a loop which runs up to 10 iterations.


1 --- 10
print(1)


print(10)
Advantages of loops
There are the following advantages of loops in Python.


1.It provides code re-usability.
2.Using loops, we do not need to write the same code again and again.
3.Using loops, we can traverse over the elements of data structures (array or linked lists).


There are the following loop statements in Python.

1.for loop
-------------------------
The for loop is used in the case where we need to execute some part of the code 
until the given condition is satisfied. 
It is better to use for loop if the number of iteration is known in advance.
condition checks then executes

2.while loop
-----------------------
while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until
a given condition is satisfied.
And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop
in the program is executed

first execution then check condition

3.do-while loop	
------------------------
The do-while loop continues until a given condition satisfies.
It is used when it is necessary to execute
