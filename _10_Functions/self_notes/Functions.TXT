Functions are the most important aspect of an application
function is the block of code which only runs when called.
Python allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as a function.
The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}.
A function can be called multiple times to provide re-usability and modularity to the Python program
Python provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print().
Although, the user can create its functions, which can be called user-defined functions.

There are mainly two types of functions.

User-define functions - The user-defined functions are those define by the user to perform the specific task.
Built-in functions - The built-in functions are those functions that are pre-defined in Python.

Advantages of Python functions.

*Using functions, we can avoid rewriting the same logic/code again and again in a program.
*We can call Python functions multiple times in a program and anywhere in a program.
*We can track a large Python program easily when it is divided into multiple functions.
*Re-usability is the main achievement of Python functions.
*However, Function calling is always overhead in a Python program.

user defined function:(def keyword is used to define function)

    syntax:
        def function(parameters):
           function body
          return expression


Rules:

1.The def keyword, along with the function name is used to define the function.
2.The identifier rule must follow the function name.
3.A function accepts the parameter (argument), and they can be optional.
4.The function block is started with the colon (:), and block statements must be at the same indentation.
5.The return statement is used to return the value. A function can have only one return
