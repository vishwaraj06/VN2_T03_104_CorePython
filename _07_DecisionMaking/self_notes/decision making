If Statement	==>  The if statement is used to test a specific condition. If the condition is true, a block of code (if-block) will be executed.
If - else Statement==>	The if-else statement is similar to if statement except the fact that, it also provides the block of the code for the false case of the condition to be checked. If the condition provided in the if statement is false, then the else statement will be executed.
Nested if Statement	==>  Nested if statements enable us to use if ? else statement inside an outer if statement.

if statement:
The if statement is used to test a particular condition and if the condition is true, it executes a block of code known as if-block. The condition of if statement can be any valid logical expression which can be either evaluated to true or false.

syntax :

if expression:
    statement

    example:
       a=30
       b=100
       if b>a:
        print("b is greater")

if-else statement:
The if-else statement provides an else block combined with the if statement which is executed in the false case of the condition.

If the condition is true, then the if-block is executed. Otherwise, the else-block is executed.

syntax:
  if condition:
    #statements
else:
    #another statements

    example:
        a=50
        b=33
        if a>b:
        print("a is greater")
        else:
         print("b is greater")

elif :
    if previous was not true do this

    example:
     a=12
     b=12
     a==b
     print("a and b are same")
     elif:
     print("both are different")
