'''
zipping-file contents compressed and size will reduced

Python zip() method takes iterable or containers and returns a single iterator object,
having mapped values from all the containers.

It is used to map the similar index of multiple containers so that they can be used
just using a single entity.

Parameters : Python iterables or containers ( list, string etc )
