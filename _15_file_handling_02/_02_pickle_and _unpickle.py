python- byte - pickle
The process to converts any kind of python objects (list, dict, etc.) into byte streams 
(0s and 1s) is called pickling or serialization or flattening or marshalling. 

We can converts the byte stream (generated through pickling) back into python objects by a 
process called as unpickling


# The process in which conversion of
# python object --> bytes - pickle or serialization. Here,using dump()  drop
syntax: pickle.dump(object, file)

# bytes --> python object - unpickle or deseriliazation. Here, using load()
# syntax: object=pickle.load(file)

# we need to create class for structured data of different data types string,int,float
# create a class with instance variables id, name, sal
