oops:

class: group of objects   data- logical, methods -physical
object:                   data - physical,  method - logical

encapusulation:combining data and methods to a single entity  eg .classname 

inheritence: one class property to another class    B(A)

abstraction: hidden internal functionality shows behavior   ABC  class Xyz(ABC):
from abc import ABC

class Xyz(ABC):
polymorphism: many forms  + , len, class methods


method overloading:
method overridin
mro principle
access modifiers


access specifiers:public(own, derived, other), protected(own class, derived class only ) , private(access only in own class)

methodoverloading: same method name, functionality different eg.product(a,b), product(a,b,c)  overcome with dispatcher method

method overriding: same method name, functionality same + additionality

MRO- method resolution order  M(A), M(A,B), M
