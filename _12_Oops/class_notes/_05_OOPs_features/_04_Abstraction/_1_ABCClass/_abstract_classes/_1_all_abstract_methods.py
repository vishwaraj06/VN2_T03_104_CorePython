4. ABSTRACTION :
===================
Hiding the implementation details i.e, method body

Class, Abstract Class, Interface


Inheritance: Super class Sub class
           : When all sub classes has common features ==> Define Methods Super class with body
		   : When all sub classes has unique implementation ==> 
		               - Make class as Abstract class(super class)
		               - Define abstract methods* in super class
Abstraction : 0 to 100%
0%   -- In super abstract class,all are concrete methods      define - class
50%  -- 10 methods - 5 abstract methods + 5 concrete methods  define - abstract class
100% -- In super abstract class, all are abstract methods     define - interface
