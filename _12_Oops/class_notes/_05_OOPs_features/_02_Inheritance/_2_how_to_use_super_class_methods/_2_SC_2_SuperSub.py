''' OVERRIDE *
II: All sub classes required  : a. Common  signature and 
                                b. unique implementation

                            --> method signature -  common behavior  
                            --> method body      -  unique** implementation 


   If we write classes without inheritance as below,
                 Tiger   		Lion        Cat        Dog
					 eating()    eating()    eating()   eating()
					 
	We cant understand common behavior. 
	So this will not work out.

    ==> We have to use inheritance mechanism here 
    
								Animal
									eating()

                Tiger   		Lion        Cat        Dog
					 eating()    eating()    eating()   eating()

Above mechanism is called as Method Overriding **
