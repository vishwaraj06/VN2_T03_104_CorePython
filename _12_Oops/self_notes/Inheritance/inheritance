 Inheritance:
 process of inheriting the properties of the parent class into a child class is called inheritance

  class BaseClass:
    Body of base class
  class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    Body of derived class

  Types of inheritance:
    * Single inheritance
    *Multiple Inheritance
    *Multilevel inheritance
    * Hierarchical Inheritance
    * Hybrid Inheritance

SINGLE

single inheritance, a child class inherits from a single-parent class. Here is one child class and one parent class.

MULTIPLE

multiple inheritance, one child class can inherit from multiple parent classes. So here is one child class and multiple parent classes.


MULTILEVEL

multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a child class or derived class.
Suppose three classes A, B, C. A is the superclass, B is the child class of A, C is the child class of B.
In other words, we can say a chain of classes is called multilevel inheritance.
