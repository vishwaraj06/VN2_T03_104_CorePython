Method Resolution Order(MRO) is the order by which Python looks for a method or attribute.
First, the method or attribute is searched within a class, and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting.
This order is also called the Linearization of a class, and a set of rules is called MRO (Method Resolution Order).
The MRO plays an essential role in multiple inheritances as a single method may found in multiple parent classes.

In multiple inheritance, the following search order is followed.

1>First, it searches in the current parent class if not available,
then searches in the parents class specified while inheriting (that is left to right.)
2>We can get the MRO of a class. For this purpose, we can use either the mro attribute or the mro() method
