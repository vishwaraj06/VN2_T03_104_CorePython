oops:
   class-->serves as the TEMPLATE from which the INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS are created

points on Python class:  

1.Classes are created by keyword class.
2.Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
3.Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute

Syntax:

class ClassName:
    # Statement-1
    .
    .
    .
    # Statement-N

Defining a class:
  
     class parrot()
       pass


why we need class:

1.To simplify the programming structure
2.Classes provides the ability to reuse the code
3.Grouping related functions and keeping them in one place (inside a class) provides a clean structure to the code which increases the readability of the program.
4.Classes also help in overriding any standard operator.


Objects:
  
      objects-->INSTANCES of class which consists of METHODS and PROPERTIES
  
A data filled in lass is called object.it hold the data in and classes define what data should be stored



Attributes:
      the properties of an object are called attributes.
Methods:
       1.methods are function but they are only available for class they defined
       2.They usally do processing in the class varaiable
       3.they are called via the object ad cannot be called independently
