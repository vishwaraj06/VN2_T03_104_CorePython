we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:

*args (Non Keyword Arguments)
**kwargs (Keyword Arguments)


*args:
    Python has *args which allow us to pass the variable number of non keyword arguments to function.

In the function, we should use an asterisk * before the parameter name to pass variable length arguments.
The arguments are passed as a "TUPLE" and these passed arguments make tuple inside the function with same name as the parameter excluding asterisk *

**kwargs:
    **kwargs, it allows us to pass the variable length of keyword arguments to the function.
    In the function, we use the double asterisk ** before the parameter name to denote this type of argument.
    The arguments are passed as a "DICTIONARY" and these arguments make a dictionary inside function with name same as the parameter excluding double asterisk **

Things to Remember:
*args and **kwargs are special keyword which allows function to take variable length argument.
*args passes variable number of non-keyworded arguments and on which operation of the tuple can be performed.
**kwargs passes variable number of keyword arguments dictionary to function on which operation of a dictionary can be performed.
*args and **kwargs make the function flexible.
