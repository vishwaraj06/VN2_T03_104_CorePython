A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {},
separated by comma, or by using the built-in set() function.
It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.).
But a set cannot have mutable elements like lists, sets or dictionaries as its elements. it follows hashing algorithms
